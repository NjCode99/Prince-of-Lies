	<p>Prince of Lies is a game designed with an intent to warn about the uncontrolled and quick evolution of A.I.
As Elan Musk wrote &quot;The pace of progress in artificial intelligence (I&#39;m not referring to narrow AI) is
incredibly fast. Unless you have direct exposure to groups like Deepmind, you have no idea how fast—it is
growing at a pace close to exponential. The risk of something seriously dangerous happening is in the five-
year timeframe. 10 years at most.” While AI applications are designed to help or even advance the human
experience there is a very real threat that the technology can fall in to the wrong hands leading to dire
consequence. “Prince of Lies” posses the real question that when A.I. has the capacity to think will it
ultimately turn against us? And how we may have to rely on a sympathetic A.I. to save us.</p>
